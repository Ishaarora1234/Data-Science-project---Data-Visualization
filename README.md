# About the Project learn-lang

There are many language learning tools so why have I created another one? This question might be tormenting you but let me tell you what is the new in this tool.


### Old Conventional Process
While learning a new language, you come across various phrases of it which you don't know the translation.
To know its translation, you

1.  select the text
2. copy it
3. open the browser
4. search for google translate
5. paste the text there,

and then it is finally that you know the exact translation.
This is a very tedious process.

### New Process Using Tool
This tool allows to cut short the boring process of 5 steps to just 1 step.

1. select the text

That is it.
By just one step, you will be knowing the complete exact translation.

Along with translation, you will also know proper pronunciation as this will also speak the text in the proper accent of the language.

### How to make it work

For the script to run successfully, certain modules are required.

To download those modules, you can either simply run the f1.py file from this repository which will automatically download all the prerequisite modules,

or you can download the manually by typing following commands


`$ pip3 install googletrans`

`$pip3 install google-speech`

`$sudo apt-get install sox libsox-fmt-mp3`

`$sudo aptitude install xclip`



##### Currently this is for linux users only.
##### For windows, I will be uploading another version soon.
